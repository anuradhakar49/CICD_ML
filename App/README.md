*Learn how to automate model training, evaluation, versioning, and deployment using GitHub Actions with the easiest MLOps guide available online.*

## Project Description
In this project, we will be using scikit-learn pipelines to train our random forest algorithm and build a drug classifier. After training, we will automate the evaluation process using CML. Finally, we will build and deploy the web application to Hugging Face Hub.
